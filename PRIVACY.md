RailWatch is self-hosted. The operator controls stored data and retention.

The application stores account identity, sessions, encrypted travel plans and optional ticket details, uploaded PDF originals, reminder jobs, company holidays and personal leave, encrypted Google OAuth credentials, and security audit records. Telegram reminders send route and travel/booking dates to Telegram and the connected account. WhatsApp reminders send the route and travel/booking dates to Meta and the configured recipient. Google sync sends journey and holiday events to the connected calendar. Uploaded tickets may contain passenger information; access is restricted to the account owner.

Deleting an account cascades its workspace, files, jobs, calendar connection, sessions, and tokens. Calendar events and previously delivered provider messages are external copies. Database backups have separate retention and must be protected along with the encryption key. Operators should establish and test backup, account, audit, and attachment retention policies.

Image and QR uploads are processed locally for extraction and are not uploaded or stored. PDF originals are encrypted in PostgreSQL and permanently removed seven days after cancellation or completion; journey history and entered ticket details are retained. Previously created backups have independent retention.
