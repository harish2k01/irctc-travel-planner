# RailWatch

A self-hosted train travel planner with configurable recurring journeys, booking reminders, a Kanban board, calendar, company holidays and personal leave, and private PDF ticket storage with local image/QR extraction.

## Run locally

Requires Node.js 24+ and PostgreSQL. Copy .env.example to .env, configure a fresh database and a base64-encoded 32-byte encryption key, then run:

```sh
npm ci
npm run prisma:generate
npm run prisma:migrate:deploy
npm run dev
```

Or use `docker compose up --build` for a local app, dedicated frontend, persistent backend, PostgreSQL, and one-time migrations. Compose credentials are for development only. Sign up at http://localhost:3000; the first account is administrator.

## Architecture

RailWatch runs as three separate services: a Next.js frontend, a Fastify backend, and PostgreSQL. The frontend renders pages and proxies same-origin `/api/*` requests; it has no database or provider credentials. The backend owns authentication, authorization, accounts, plans, ticket storage, SMTP, and integrations. Both application services use the same versioned image with `RAILWATCH_SERVICE=frontend` or `backend` and can be scaled separately.

Scheduled work runs inside the persistent backend. Once a minute it completes booked journeys after their travel date in IST, archives cancelled or skipped journeys seven days after cancellation, replenishes routines, reads Telegram messages with outgoing requests, reconciles reminders, delivers due jobs, and synchronizes calendars. PostgreSQL advisory locking prevents overlapping scheduler runs across replicas. Reminder jobs retain their durable leases, retries, and delivery records. Regular API requests never spawn Kubernetes jobs. One-time database migrations and database backups remain operational jobs.

`BACKEND_URL` points the frontend to the private backend (default `http://127.0.0.1:3001`). The backend listens on `BACKEND_PORT` (default 3001). Only the frontend needs to be exposed. `APP_URL` is the canonical URL users access, including an HTTP LAN URL if hosting without a domain. Provider traffic is outgoing; optional OAuth consent returns through the user's browser. See [service deployment](docs/service-architecture.md).

## Deployment and providers

[Deployment guide](docs/railwatch-deployment.md) covers GHCR releases, manual Kubernetes hosting, secrets, backups, WhatsApp setup, and Google Calendar OAuth. Providers can be configured later.

[Booking and cancellation reminders](docs/booking-reminders.md) explains normal/Tatkal dates, custom reminder schedules, cancellation follow-ups, and device notifications.

The dashboard is at `/`; journeys, calendar, routines, holidays, tickets, and admin pages have their own routes. User Settings manages profile details, phone number, preferences, connections, and passwords. Admin Settings contains General, Integrations, and User Management. Administrators control shared booking rules and features, configure encrypted Telegram/Google/WhatsApp credentials in the app, create or invite users, and manage roles and access. Each account has a private workspace. The notification bell links to paginated delivery history with snooze/resume controls; optional quiet hours are configured under Preferences. See [notification controls](docs/notification-controls.md).

Set `APP_URL` to the public base URL at runtime so invitation links, password resets, and Google OAuth use the deployed hostname. The first account becomes administrator. Existing RailWatch installations can apply the checked-in Prisma migrations; a fresh installation starts with an empty database.

## Tickets and history

Ticket extraction reads PDF text and QR codes, and uses local browser OCR for scanned PDFs and ticket images. English recognition assets ship with the app; recognition does not send ticket pixels to an external service. Review detected details before applying them. Completed journeys appear in History and archived cancellations retain entered ticket details. Original PDFs are deleted seven days after cancellation or completion.

## Verify

`npm run verify` runs type checking, lint, coverage, and the production build. Database tests need `RUN_DB_TESTS=1` and an isolated database ending in `_test`. Browser tests need `RUN_E2E=1`, that isolated database, and Playwright Chromium: `npm run test:e2e`. The browser suite resets the test database.

## Releases

Every PR needs exactly one label: `major`, `minor`, or `patch`. After merge, validation runs before release reconciliation assigns the next version to each merged PR in order. The release workflow publishes that exact commit to GHCR with `vX.Y.Z`, `X.Y.Z`, full commit-SHA, and latest aliases. The `image.json` release asset records the digest for manual deployment. Retries reuse an existing commit image. Apply the migrations for each release; ordinary upgrades preserve the existing database.

Deployment charts and Argo CD definitions remain local until GitOps deployment is enabled.

## Ticket files and retention

Uploaded PDF originals are encrypted in PostgreSQL's `RailFile` table. They are not stored on a frontend or backend pod filesystem. Open **View Ticket** in Ticket Vault or a journey's attachments to read the original inside RailWatch; PDFs support page navigation. Images and QR codes extract details locally and are not uploaded or stored. Download and remove actions use the attachment menu.

The backend scheduler permanently removes original files seven days after cancellation or completion, including for disabled accounts. It also removes their attachment references atomically. Journey history, entered ticket details, and notes remain available in the archive. Historical database backups retain their own independent retention policy.

## Operations and code navigation

Frontend API gateway logs and backend request logs share `x-request-id`, with method, route, status, and duration. Successful health checks are suppressed. Scheduler, Telegram polling, Google synchronization, SMTP delivery, reminder failures, and file cleanup emit structured JSON to stdout/stderr. Logs exclude credentials, cookies, ticket contents, and request bodies. Inspect them with `kubectl -n railwatch logs deployment/railwatch-frontend` or `kubectl -n railwatch logs deployment/railwatch-backend`.

SMTP authentication can succeed even when a sender address is rejected. The Sender field must use an address or verified alias authorized for the authenticated account. The test action reports sender rejection separately from authentication and connectivity failures.

`src/backend/server.ts` handles API routing; `src/backend/scheduler.ts` elects a scheduler leader. `src/lib/railwatch-store.ts` manages encrypted workspaces and concurrent edits; `travel-planner.ts` owns planning and journey lifecycle rules; `ticket-retention.ts` selects expired originals; `railwatch-jobs.ts` dispatches reminders. UI components live under `src/components/travel-planner`. Named methods include purpose comments. Existing database table names and applied migration directory names are intentionally preserved to keep upgrades compatible.

## Product scope and readiness

The current application implements the planning and reminder core. [Production readiness](docs/production-readiness.md) records remaining work and decisions that replaced the original design plan. Demo data and interactive prototype routes are not part of the shipped app. Synthetic data remains only in test fixtures.

### Email booking reminders

Configure and test SMTP under Admin Settings. Users verify their saved email under User Settings → Profile, confirm the emailed link, and opt into Email Reminders under Connections. Verification links expire after 24 hours and can be used once. Changing the email pauses delivery until the new address is verified. Reminders use branded HTML with a plain-text alternative and the backend's durable schedule/retry queue; failures appear in the notification bell. SMTP is optional for self-hosting and does not block initial administrator setup or signup.
